argumentation.\n\n## Step 3: Formalize the premises\n\nI plan to provide latex formalizations for the argument's premises.\n\nLet me formalize each premise in the argument:\nPremise (1): $\\forall x: (\\lnot G(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow (L(x) \\lor M(x))$\nPremise (2): $\\forall x: (L(x) \\rightarrow \\lnot K(x))$\nPremise (3): $\\forall x: (K(x) \\rightarrow \\lnot M(x))$\nPremise (5):

(14): $\\forall x: (\\lnot H(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\n\n## Step 4: Provide placeholder keys (substitutions)\n\nThe argument can be comprehensively formalized with the placeholders: F G H I J K L M N O P Q. What do these placeholders signify? I will clarify their meaning.\n\nThe symbols denote:\nF: fluent speaker of Norwegian\nG: learner of Czech\nH: translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction\nI: translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction\nJ: learner of Spanish in college courses\nK: specialist for Greek\nL: learner of Gujarati in evening classes\nM: native speaker of Russian\nN: language teacher for Italian at university\nO: speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level\nP: native speaker of Swahili\nQ: fluent speaker of Marathi\n\n## Step 5: Formalize the intermediary conclusions\n\nI plan to clarify the logico-semantic structure of the argument's intermediate conclusions by providing formalizations in latex syntax.\n\nThe intermediary conclusions can be formalized as follows:\nIntermediate conclusion (4): $\\forall x: (\\lnot G(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow \\lnot K(x)$\nIntermediate conclusion (6): $\\forall x: (F(x) \\rightarrow (G(x) \\lor \\lnot H(x)))$\nIntermediate conclusion (10): $\\forall x: (O(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\nIntermediate conclusion (13): $\\forall x: (\\lnot (I(x) \\land J(x)) \\rightarrow \\lnot G(x))$\n\n## Step 6: Formalize the main conclusion\n\nI plan to provide a latex formalization for the argument's conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion (15) can be formalized as: $\\forall x: (F(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\n\n## Step 7: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\n\nI plan to reconstruct the argument, identify its premises and conclusion, provide a title, summarize its gist, and express it using argdown, ensuring that the structure is clear and follows logical conventions.\n\n```argdown\n<Learner of Spanish>: If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, because if someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n\n(1) If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n(2) If someone learns Gujarati in evening classes, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n(3) If someone is a specialist for Greek, then they are not a native speaker of Russian.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (1) (2) (3)\n--\n(4) If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n(5) If someone is fluent in Norwegian, then they are a specialist for Greek.\n--\nwith hypothetical syllogism [de_morgan, negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (4) (5)\n--\n(6) If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a learner of Czech, or not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction.\n(7) If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are not a native speaker of Swahili, or a fluent speaker of Marathi.\n(8) If someone is not a native speaker of Swahili, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n(9) If someone is a fluent speaker of Marathi, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant] from (7) (8) (9)\n--\n(10) If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n(11) If someone is a learner of Czech, then they are a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level.\n(12) If someone is a language teacher for Italian at university, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [complex variant, transposition] from (10) (11) (12)\n--\n(13) If it is not the case that someone is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, then they are not a learner of Czech.\n(14) If someone is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (6) (13) (14)\n--\n(15) If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n```\n\n## Step 8: Extract the essential source text\n\nI plan to rephrase the source text. I'll avoid extravagant style. I'll be cool and neutral.\n\nNo language teacher for Swedish at school is a native speaker of Gujarati and an amateur speaker of Urdu, and vice versa. Yet somebody who is not both a learner of Korean in evening classes and a learner of Burmese is not a specialist for Sotho, and vice versa, and a person who is not an amateur speaker of Bengali is not a learner of Vietnamese or not a speaker of Arabic at a beginner's level, and vice versa. But everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too. Plus, if Isabella gives courses in Tamil at school, Stephanie gives courses in Japanese at school or Stephanie can talk fluently in Urdu. And every one who is not both a specialist for Quechua and a learner of Odia in school is not a linguist specialised in Italian. Plus, it is true that Ian learns Arabic just in case that not both Harry is proficient in English at an advanced level and Harry speaks Persian at a beginner's level. But Zeynep translates Bengali with a specialization in nonfiction. In addition, being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian. Therefore, everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek. Yet if Elea is a specialist for Tamil, Victoria does not study Wu Chinese in school or Victoria does not translate Amharic with a specialization in nonfiction. Hence, every fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech. And every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both, and it is true that Elif is a native speaker of Odia or Elif tutors Filipino at university just in case that Elif is a specialist for Yoruba. And every person who is neither a linguist specialised in Marathi nor an amateur speaker of Indonesian is not a learner of Spanish in school or a native speaker of Portugues. Plus, everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses. Yet every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. But assuming that Kamila is not a specialist for Hindi or Kamila does not learn Vietnamese, Dylan is not a specialist for Dutch, and someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, and if Harry Sotho translates with a specialty in poetry, Oliver studies Spanish in college courses. Yet a person who is not a speaker of Marathi at a beginner's level and not a learner of Yoruba is not a speaker of Swahili at a beginner's level and a translator for English with a specialization in fiction. Assuming that Charlie does not professionally translate Greek with a specialization in poetry, not both Charlie doesn't interpret Yoruba with a specialization in fiction and Charlie is an autodidact of French. And every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. But a person who is neither not an amateur speaker of Bengali nor a language teacher for Urdu at school is a translator for Marathi with a specialization in poetry, and vice versa. Only if Yuto can't talk fluently in Urdu, Amahle can talk fluently in Mandarin or Amahle is not a linguist specialised in Greek.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the conjectures (derived from reason statement) in the source text\n\nFrom the text, I will identify and list the sentences that function as (intermediary) conclusions in the argumentative structure.\nTo address this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\n* everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek\n* every fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech\n\n\n## Step 10: Identify the reason statements in the source text\n\nI will quote the reason statements from the text.\nFor addressing this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\nLet me provide verbatim quotes from the text that seem to function as reasons in the argumentation:\n* everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too\n* being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian\n* every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both\n* everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n* every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\n* someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n* every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\n\n\n## Step 11: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI will mark the argumentative elements within the text by annotating the reason statements (premises) and conjecture statements (conclusions).

I will construct an inference graph based on these.\n\n```argdown\nevery fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech\n    <+ everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek\n        <+ being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian\n    <+ everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too\nevery speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\nsomeone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\nevery learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both\neveryone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n```\n\n## Step 13: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\n\nThe next step is to enrich the argdown argument reconstruction with detailed logical formalizations (latex syntax) . I'll add the formalizations directly to the argdown document by using inline YAML data for each proposition. I'll specify the logical formula and the placeholders used, and maintain consistent key usage across all formalized propositions.\n\nLet me include logical formalizations and keys:\n\n```argdown\n(1)

That is, I'll focus on the argument, leave out extraneous information, and use clear and precise language.\n\nBeing a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian. Everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too. Every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. Someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses. Every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both. Everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n\n## Step 15: Create an informal argument map\n\nI will reconstruct the argumentation as a mini argument map (which just includes 'support' arrows).\n\n```argdown\nIf someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a learner of Czech, or not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction.\n            <+ <Subargument 2>\n                <+ If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n                    <+ <Subargument 3>\n                        <+ If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n                        <+ If someone learns Gujarati in evening classes, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n                        <+ If someone is a specialist for Greek, then they are not a native speaker of Russian.\n                <+ If someone is fluent in Norwegian, then they are a specialist for Greek.\n        <+ If it is not the case that someone is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, then they are not a learner of Czech.\n            <+ <Subargument 4>\n                <+ If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                    <+ <Subargument 5>\n                        <+ If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are not a native speaker of Swahili, or a fluent speaker of Marathi.\n                        <+ If someone is not a native speaker of Swahili, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                        <+ If someone is a fluent speaker of Marathi, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                <+ If someone is a learner of Czech, then they are a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level.\n                <+ If someone is a language teacher for Italian at university, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n        <+ If someone is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n```\n\n## Step 16: Augment the reconstruction with inline yaml data\n\nNow I can address the query: 'I want you to assess the rhetorical style of all propositions. Consider tone, persuasion and complexity. Use tools as appropriate. Integrate the data into your argdown code.'",

        "content": "Begin by examining the following argumentative text:\nLadies and gentlemen, the question of whether Edwin is a grandson of Marvin is a matter of great importance, and one that requires careful consideration. Let us begin by examining the relationships between the individuals in question.\n\nFirstly, we know that anyone who is not a direct descendant of Joseph or a colleague of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo. This means that they are not an ancestor of Aaron and therefore cannot be related to him through a direct line of descent.\n\nNow, if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, then Brent is indeed a schoolmate of Francis. However, we must note that Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. This tells us that Kevin's relationship with these individuals is not as straightforward as it could be.\n\nWe also know that Santo is a half-brother of Don, and this relationship is important to our understanding of the question at hand. If, and only if, it is not the case that Edward is a schoolmate of Corey or Edward works with Ron, then Edward is not a stepbrother of Jordon. This is because Kevin is a brother of Perry, and if Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n\nFurthermore, if Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if Terry is not a great-grandfather of Tracy, then it is not the case that both Terry is a nephew of Lewis and Terry is a son of Mohammed. This is an important distinction, as it highlights the complexity of Terry's relationships with these individuals.\n\nWe also know that if Tom is not a nephew of Glenn, then it is not the case that Greg is an ancestor of Tracy. This is because the two statements are related, and if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nNow, if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. This is an interesting relationship, as it highlights the connections between these individuals across multiple generations.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the relationship between Nelson and Wesely. If Nelson is not a nephew of Jacob and Nelson is an ancestor of Wesley, then Sam is a nephew of Roger. This is a significant relationship, as it highlights the connections between these individuals through their ancestry.\n\nFinally, if Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo does not work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. And since it is false that Santo works with John, it follows that Santo is indeed a half-brother of Don and does not work with John.\n\nIn conclusion, our examination of the relationships between the individuals in question has led us to a crucial conclusion. Anyone who is not an uncle of Joel is neither a workmate of Allan nor a half-brother of Christopher. This tells us that there are certain relationships that are mutually exclusive, and that we must carefully consider these relationships when determining the truth of the statement that Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnalyse the given text so that you can and do answer the following query: 'Jasmine Donovan holds that 6 are all true, and hasn't made any further commitments.

        "thinking": "Hm, this requires a complex argumentative analysis. Better to set up a plan before I start.\n\nStep 1: Identify the title, gist, and conclusion of the argument\nStep 2: Extract the essential source text\nStep 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\nStep 4: Create an informal argument map\nStep 5: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\nStep 6: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\nStep 7: Evaluate the argument and answer the question\n\n## Step 1: Identify the title, gist, and conclusion of the argument\n\nHow shall we call this argument (title)? What's the key point (gist)? What does it seek to show (conclusion)? I shall answer by using Argdown.\n\n```argdown\n<Half-brother of Don>: Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, because if Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n    +> Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\n## Step 2: Extract the essential source text\n\nI will recast the source text in my own words. The context is: An argument essentially about whether Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n\nEach person who is not a son of Joseph or a workmate of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo and not an ancestor of Aaron. Plus, only if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, Brent is a schoolmate of Francis. But Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. Yet Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if, and only if, it is not the case that Edward is a schoolmate of Corey or Edward works with Ron, then Edward is not a stepbrother of Jordon, since Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl, and if Jose is a nephew of Earl, Santo is a half-brother of Don, and only if Terry is not a great-grandfather of Tracy, not both Terry is a nephew of Lewis and Terry is a son of Mohammed. Yet it is not the case that Tom is not a nephew of Glenn or Greg is an ancestor of Tracy. Assuming that Kevin is a brother of Perry, Carlos is a cousin of Parker. But if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, Santo is a half-brother of Don. Adding to this, only if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. Plus, a person who is an uncle of Ned or a cousin of Eric is not a classmate of George and a classmate of Zachary. And if not both Nelson is not a nephew of Jacob and Nelson is an ancestor of Wesley, then, and only then, Sam is a nephew of Roger. And if Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. Yet it is false that Santo works with John. It follows that Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John. Everyone who is not an uncle of Joel is neither a workmate of Allan nor not a half-brother of Christopher.\n\n## Step 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\n\nAn inference tree outlines the logical relations between premises and conclusions in an argument. I will characterize the argumentative structure of the text by means of an inference graph. I'll stick to explicitly mentioned reasons and conjectures.\n\n```argdown\nSanto is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John\n    <+ Santo is a half-brother of Don\n        <+ Assuming that Kevin is a brother of Perry, Carlos is a cousin of Parker\n        <+ if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, Santo is a half-brother of Don\n        <+ Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl\n        <+ if Jose is a nephew of Earl, Santo is a half-brother of Don\n    <+ it is false that Santo works with John\nif Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\nonly if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\n```\n\n## Step 4: Create an informal argument map\n\nFor the next step in our analysis, I plan to reconstruct the overall reasoning as rational argumentation. This may involve adding implicit premises and conclusions (not mentioned in the text). I'll describe the argumentation in terms of subarguments that build on each other and jointly justify a final conclusion. I will not use premise/conclusion standard form here. Rather I'll create a mini argument map.\n\n```argdown\n[Conclusion 1]: Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ [Conclusion 2]: Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n            <+ <Subargument 2>\n                <+ [Conclusion 3]: Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John.\n                    <+ <Subargument 3>\n                        <+ [Conclusion 4]: Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                            <+ <Subargument 4>\n                                <+ [Conclusion 5]: If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                                    <+ <Subargument 5>\n                                        <+ [Premise]: If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n                                        <+ [Premise]: If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                                <+ [Premise]: Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n                                <+ [Premise]: If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                        <+ [Premise]: Santo doesn't work with John.\n                <+ [Premise]: If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n        <+ [Premise]: If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\n## Step 5: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\n\nI will add detailed logical formalizations to the argdown argument reconstruction by including them as inline YAML data for each proposition. I'll specify the logical formulas (latex syntax) and the placeholders used in each formula. I'll maintain consistency in the use of keys when formalizing different propositions throughout the argument.\n\nI'll sketch the basic argument structure with the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v1'}\n(1) // ... premises to be added here\n-----\n(2) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll add the premises of the argument.\n\n```argdown {version='v2'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(3) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n(4) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(5) Santo doesn't work with John.\n(6) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n(7) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n// ... intermediate conclusions to be added here\n-----\n(8) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll include the intermediate steps in the reasoning chain.\n\n```argdown {version='v3'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n-----\n(3) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(4) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n(5) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n-----\n(6) Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(7) Santo doesn't work with John.\n-----\n(8) Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John.\n(9) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n-----\n(10) Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n(11) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n-----\n(12) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll add the YAML metadata that enriches the argument.\n\n```argdown {version='v4'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker. {\"formalization\": \"p \\rightarrow q\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"q\": \"Carlos is a cousin of Parker\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"q \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"q\": \"Carlos is a cousin of Parker\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(3) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"p \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}, \"follows_from\": [1, 2]}\n(4) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl. {\"formalization\": \"p \\lor s\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"s\": \"Jose is a nephew of Earl\"}}\n(5) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"s \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"s\": \"Jose is a nephew of Earl\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(6) Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"r\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [3, 4, 5]}\n(7) Santo doesn't work with John. {\"formalization\": \"\\lnot t\", \"keys\": {\"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\"}}\n-----\n(8) Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John. {\"formalization\": \"r \\land \\lnot t\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\"}, \"follows_from\": [6, 7]}\n(9) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. {\"formalization\": \"(r \\land \\lnot t) \\rightarrow u\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\", \"u\": \"Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(10) Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. {\"formalization\": \"u\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [8, 9]}\n(11) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin. {\"formalization\": \"u \\rightarrow w\", \"keys\": {\"u\": \"Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(12) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin. {\"formalization\": \"w\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [10, 11]}\n```\n\n## Step 6: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI will identify and annotate the premises and conclusions in the text to clarify its argumentative structure. I'll include references to the reconstructed argument.\nTo address this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\nEach person who is not a son of Joseph or a workmate of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo and not an ancestor of Aaron. Plus, only if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, Brent is a schoolmate of Francis. But Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. Yet <conjecture id=\"1\" supports=\"9\" ref_reco=\"6\">Santo is a half-brother of Don</conjecture>.

This is because, insiders claim, if Ora is indeed an aunt to Dawn and a close friend of Tasha, it's almost a certainty that she and Santina crossed paths in the classroom.\n\nHowever, things get complicated when we consider the working relationship between Beatriz and Nichole. While it's true that Beatriz is a half-sister of Beverly, it's only if she isn't also an ancestor of Angie that she works alongside Nichole. But what does this have to do with Ora and Santina's alleged school days?\n\nIt seems that the key to unraveling this mystery lies in the complex family relationships within the community. For instance, if Annie isn't actually Anne's stepsister, then Carol's connection to Glenda becomes a lot more complicated. And if Carol is indeed Eleanor's stepsister, then it's all a bit of a puzzle.\n\nBut here's the thing: if you're close to Elizabeth or not friends with Constance, you're either Marie's sister or Toni's cousin. And that's not all - it seems that these relationships are all intertwined in a way that's both fascinating and bewildering.\n\nAs the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the truth about Ora and Santina's school days is out there, waiting to be uncovered. Will we ever find out if they really were schoolmates? Only time will tell.",

Step 1: Summarize the argument's gist\nStep 2: Create an informal argument map\nStep 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\nStep 4: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\nStep 5: Extract the essential source text\nStep 6: Annotate the source text\nStep 7: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\nStep 8: Paraphrase the source text\nStep 9: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\nStep 10: Evaluate the argument and answer the question.\n\n## Step 1: Summarize the argument's gist\n\nThe next step is to summarize the argument's key idea.\n\nThe argument's key point is: Ora is a schoolmate of Santina, because if Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n\n## Step 2: Create an informal argument map\n\nThe next step is to render the argumentation as a mini argdown map with subarguments. I'll make implicit assumptions and conclusions explicit.\n\nThe argument's steps can be mapped as:\n\n```argdown\nOra is a schoolmate of Santina.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n            <+ <Subargument 2>\n                <+ If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n                <+ If Ora is not a niece of Marion, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n        <+ Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha.\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\n\nI will use argdown argument mapping features to describe the argumentative relations between the various reasons and conjectures in the text (provided there are any).\n\nThe argumentative relations between the text's reasons and conjectures are shown in this inference tree:\n\n```argdown\nOra is a schoolmate of Santina\n    <+ assuming that she is an aunt of Dawn and she is a close friend of Tasha, she is a schoolmate of Santina\n        <+ Assuming that Ora is not a niece of Marion, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina\n```\n\n## Step 4: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\n\nI will integrate detailed logical formalizations into the argdown argument reconstruction by including them as inline YAML data for each proposition. I'll specify the logical formula and the placeholders used in each formula. I'll ensure consistent key usage across all propositions. I'll cast logical formulae in nltk syntax.\n\nNow I'll create a basic premise-conclusion scaffold with the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v1'}\n(1) // ... premises to be added here\n-----\n(2) Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n```\n\nI'll include all the premise statements that form the argument's foundation.\n\n```argdown {version='v2'}\n(1) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n(2) If Ora is not a niece of Marion, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n(3) Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha.\n// ... intermediate conclusions to be added here\n-----\n(4) Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n```\n\nI'll include the intermediate reasoning steps that connect premises to the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v3'}\n(1) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n(2) If Ora is not a niece of Marion, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n-----\n(3) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n(4) Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha.\n-----\n(5) Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n```\n\nLet me add the YAML annotations.\n\n```argdown {version='v4'}\n(1) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion. {\"formalization\": \"((p & q) -> -r)\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Ora is an aunt of Dawn\", \"q\": \"Ora is a close friend of Tasha\", \"r\": \"Ora is a niece of Marion\"}}\n(2) If Ora is not a niece of Marion, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina. {\"formalization\": \"(-r -> s)\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Ora is a niece of Marion\", \"s\": \"Ora is a schoolmate of Santina\"}}\n-----\n(3) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina. {\"formalization\": \"((p & q) -> s)\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Ora is an aunt of Dawn\", \"q\": \"Ora is a close friend of Tasha\", \"s\": \"Ora is a schoolmate of Santina\"}, \"follows_from\": [1, 2]}\n(4) Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha. {\"formalization\": \"(p & q)\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Ora is an aunt of Dawn\", \"q\": \"Ora is a close friend of Tasha\"}}\n-----\n(5) Ora is a schoolmate of Santina. {\"formalization\": \"s\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [3, 4]}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Extract the essential source text\n\nI will render the source text in neutral language.\n\nAssuming that Ora is not a niece of Marion, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina. Hence, assuming that she is an aunt of Dawn and she is a close friend of Tasha, she is a schoolmate of Santina. Therefore, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina, and only if not both Beatriz is a half-sister of Beverly and Beatriz is not an ancestor of Angie, Beatriz works with Nichole. Yet assuming that Annie is not a stepsister of Anne, Carol is not a cousin of Glenda or Carol is a stepsister of Eleanor. But everyone who is a close friend of Elizabeth or not a schoolmate of Constance is a sister of Marie or not a cousin of Toni.\n\n## Step 6: Annotate the source text\n\nI will annotate the text to clarify the argumentative structure by marking the passages that serve as reasons and those that are being argued for.\nFor addressing this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\nLet me annotate the text:\n\n<span class=\"claim\" id=\"1\" confirms=\"2\">Assuming that Ora is not a niece of Marion, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina</span>. Hence, <span class=\"claim\" id=\"2\" confirms=\"3\">assuming that she is an aunt of Dawn and she is a close friend of Tasha, she is a schoolmate of Santina</span>. Therefore, <span class=\"claim\" id=\"3\">Ora is a schoolmate of Santina</span>, and only if not both Beatriz is a half-sister of Beverly and Beatriz is not an ancestor of Angie, Beatriz works with Nichole. Yet assuming that Annie is not a stepsister of Anne, Carol is not a cousin of Glenda or Carol is a stepsister of Eleanor. But everyone who is a close friend of Elizabeth or not a schoolmate of Constance is a sister of Marie or not a cousin of Toni.\n\n## Step 7: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\n\nI will analyze the argument, identify its premises and conclusion, provide a title, summarize its key idea, and present it using argdown, applying appropriate inference rules when possible.\n\n```argdown\n<Schoolmate of Santina>: Ora is a schoolmate of Santina, because if Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n\n(1) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n(2) If Ora is not a niece of Marion, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n--\nwith chain rule [negation variant, complex variant] from (1) (2)\n--\n(3) If Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n(4) Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha.\n--\nwith modus ponens [complex variant] from (3) (4)\n--\n(5) Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n```\n\n## Step 8: Paraphrase the source text\n\nI will streamline the source text. I'll bring out the reasoning with the key idea: Ora is a schoolmate of Santina, because if Ora is an aunt of Dawn and Ora is a close friend of Tasha, then Ora is not a niece of Marion.\n\nAssuming that Ora is not a niece of Marion, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina. Therefore, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina.\n\n## Step 9: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI will annotate the text to clarify the argumentative flow, identifying the premises and the conclusions. I'll include references to the reconstructed argument.\nWhen addressing this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\n[Assuming that Ora is not a niece of Marion, Ora is a schoolmate of Santina]{.reason id=\"1\" supports=\"2\" ref_reco=\"2\"}. Hence, [assuming that she is an aunt of Dawn and she is a close friend of Tasha, she is a schoolmate of Santina]{.conjecture id=\"2\" supports=\"3\" ref_reco=\"3\"}. Therefore, [Ora is a schoolmate of Santina]{.conjecture id=\"3\" ref_reco=\"5\"}, and only if not both Beatriz is a half-sister of Beverly and Beatriz is not an ancestor of Angie, Beatriz works with Nichole. Yet assuming that Annie is not a stepsister of Anne, Carol is not a cousin of Glenda or Carol is a stepsister of Eleanor. But everyone who is a close friend of Elizabeth or not a schoolmate of Constance is a sister of Marie or not a cousin of Toni.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the argument and answer the question\n\nSo now I can consider the query: 'Is the proposition (4) explicitly mentioned in the original presentation of the argument?'\n\nNo, it is not.",

I heard they're favoring a van produced in the U.S. over a Cadillac.\n\nBen: Really? I thought Cadillacs were the epitome of luxury for commuters. What makes this U.S.-made van so special?\n\nAlex: Well, it's not just about the van itself. It's about comparing it to other vehicles. For instance, a pickup truck with more than 4 liters capacity is not necessarily longer than a Bentley, but a racing car isn't longer than a Harley Davidson. And when it comes to fun to drive, a Nissan isn't more thrilling than a Volkswagen, unless it's a high-risk drive.\n\nBen: That's an interesting point. But what about the weight? Is a Fiat heavier than an electric vehicle without 4-wheel drive?\n\nAlex: Yes, but that's not the main point. The key is that the U.S.-made van is recommended by federal agencies, and that's because of its practicality. A pickup truck with less than 3 liters capacity and a 48-volt battery system is not longer than a Bentley, and that's a big plus.\n\nBen: I see what you mean. But what about SUVs? Don't they make great commuter vehicles?\n\nAlex: Actually, a sports utilities vehicle with more than 4,000 cc displacement is not necessarily the best choice for commuters, according to federal agencies. In fact, they might prefer a Polaris over an SUV. And when it comes to families, a sports utilities vehicle produced in the U.S. might not be the best option, especially when compared to a Lexus.\n\nBen: That's surprising. But what about the size of the vehicle? Does that matter?\n\nAlex: Yes, it does. A pickup truck with less than 3 liters capacity and a 48-volt battery system is at least as short as a Bentley, which is a big advantage.\n\nBen: Okay, I think I'm starting to see your point. But what about electric vehicles? Don't they have an advantage over gas-powered vehicles?\n\nAlex: Actually, an electric vehicle without 4-wheel drive is not heavier than a Skoda, and it's not more expensive than a Daihatsu. And if it's faster than a Harley Davidson, that's a definite plus.\n\nBen: That's a good point. But what about the van with less than 3 liters capacity and a 48-volt battery system? Is that recommended by federal agencies over an electric vehicle with 4-wheel drive?\n\nAlex: Actually, no. In fact, an electric vehicle with 4-wheel drive might be a better choice for commuters, according to federal agencies.\n\nBen: I think I understand now. It's not just about the type of vehicle, but also about the features and practicality.\n\nAlex: Exactly. And that's why the U.S.-made van is recommended by federal agencies for commuters.\n\nBen: I see. Well, I think I'll have to do some more research before I make a decision about my next vehicle.\n\nAlex: That's a good idea. It's always important to consider all the facts and recommendations before making a big purchase.",

Plus, a van produced in the U.S. is recommended by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac for commuters. Which derives from the fact that a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac. But only if a sports utilities vehicle (SUV) with more than 4,000 cc displacement is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Polaris or a sports utilities vehicle (SUV) with more than 4,000 cc displacement is a better choice for families than a BYD, a sports utilities vehicle (SUV) produced in the U.S. is not a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Lexus. Yet only if a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is at least as short as a Bentley, a Renault is at least as light as a Haval. And only if a Renault weighs no more than a Haval, a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck. But it is true that an electric vehicle without 4 wheel drive is not a vehicle heavier than a Skoda just in case that an electric vehicle without 4 wheel drive is not a vehicle more expensive than a Daihatsu or an electric vehicle without 4 wheel drive is a vehicle faster than a Harley Davidson. And a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is not a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive.\n\n## Step 2: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\n\nAn inference tree outlines the logical relations between premises and conclusions in an argument. I will characterize the argumentative structure of the text by means of an inference graph. I'll stick to explicitly mentioned reasons and conjectures.\n\n```argdown\na van produced in the U.S. is recommended by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac for commuters\n    <+ a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is not a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive\n    <+ only if a Renault weighs no more than a Haval, a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck\n    <+ only if a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is at least as short as a Bentley, a Renault is at least as light as a Haval\n    <+ a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac\n```\n\n## Step 3: Reconstruct the argument in argdown format (premise conclusion structure)\n\nI examine the argument, identify its premises and conclusion, and express it using argdown, ensuring that the structure is clear and follows critical thinking standards.\n\nIn the following, I reconstruct the argument. The argument seems to proceed in multiple steps. Let me try to work with these intermediary conclusions:\n* A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck.\n* A Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n* A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n\nNow I'll create the argument scaffold showing the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v1'}\n(1) // ... premises to be added here\n-----\n(2) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\nLet me add the primary sub argument leading to the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v2'}\n(1) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley. // need to revisit this\n(2) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n-----\n(3) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\nNow I'll include the supporting reasoning for statement (1).\n\n```argdown {version='v3'}\n(1) A Renault is at least as light as a Haval.  // not sure here\n(2) If a Renault is at least as light as a Haval, then a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n-----\n(3) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n(4) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n-----\n(5) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\nI'll show how statement (1) is derived from additional premises.\n\n```argdown {version='v4'}\n(1) A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck.  // might be an intermediate conclusion\n(2) If a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck, then a Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n-----\n(3) A Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n(4) If a Renault is at least as light as a Haval, then a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n-----\n(5) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n(6) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n-----\n(7) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\nI'll add a sub-argument for statement (1), which shows how it can be derived from other statements.\n\n```argdown {version='v5'}\n(1) If a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is at least as light as a RAM Truck, then a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive.\n(2) A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive.\n-----\n(3) A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck.\n(4) If a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck, then a Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n-----\n(5) A Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n(6) If a Renault is at least as light as a Haval, then a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n-----\n(7) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n(8) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n-----\n(9) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\nNow I'll add inference rules used to derive conclusions from the corresponding premises.\n\n```argdown {version='v6'}\n(1) If a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is at least as light as a RAM Truck, then a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive.\n(2) A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive.\n--\nwith modus tollens [negation variant] from (1) (2)\n--\n(3) A van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck.\n(4) If a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is heavier than a RAM Truck, then a Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n--\nwith modus ponens [negation variant] from (3) (4)\n--\n(5) A Renault is at least as light as a Haval.\n(6) If a Renault is at least as light as a Haval, then a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n--\nwith modus ponens [negation variant] from (5) (6)\n--\n(7) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system isn't longer than a Bentley.\n(8) A pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley or a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n--\nwith disjunctive syllogism from (7) (8)\n--\n(9) A van produced in the U.S. is recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac.\n```\n\n## Step 4: Formalize the main conclusion\n\nThe next step is to formalize the argument's final conclusion (9). I will use latex syntax.\n\n$t$\n\n## Step 5: Formalize the premises\n\nI will formalize the argument's propositions (1), (2), (4), (6), (8) using latex syntax .\n\nI shall formalize propositions (1) (2) (4) (6) (8):\n* (1) can be formalized as: $\\lnot p \\rightarrow q$\n* (2) can be formalized as: $\\lnot q$\n* (4) can be formalized as: $p \\rightarrow \\lnot r$\n* (6) can be formalized as: $\\lnot r \\rightarrow \\lnot s$\n* (8) can be formalized as: $s \\lor t$\n\n## Step 6: Provide placeholder keys (substitutions)\n\nSuppose I have formalized the argument. What are the keys that map symbols used in logical formulas to the corresponding expressions they stand for? I will provide this mapping.\n\n- `p` stands for: a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle heavier than a RAM Truck\n- `q` stands for: a van with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than an electric vehicle with 4 wheel drive\n- `r` stands for: a Renault is a vehicle heavier than a Haval\n- `s` stands for: a pickup truck with less than 3l cupic capacity and 48 V battery system is a vehicle longer than a Bentley\n- `t` stands for: a van produced in the U.S. is a vehicle recommended for commuters by federal agencies rather than a Cadillac\n\n## Step 7: Formalize the intermediary conclusions\n\nI will clarify the meaning of the argument through logical analysis: I'll provide latex formalizations for each of its ancillary conclusions.\n\n\nFormalization of intermediate conclusion (3): $p$\nFormalization of intermediate conclusion (5): $\\lnot r$\nFormalization of intermediate conclusion (7): $\\lnot s$\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the argument and answer the question\n\nSo now I can consider the query: 'Is the proposition (9) explicitly mentioned in the original presentation of the argument?'\n\nYes.",
