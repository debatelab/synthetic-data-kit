        "thinking": "I need to annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction. This requires a complex analysis. Let me draw up a plan. Step 1: Create an informal argument map\nStep 2: Reconstruct the argument in argdown format (premise conclusion structure)\nStep 3: Identify the title and gist of the argument\nStep 4: Paraphrase the source text\nStep 5: Identify the reason statements in the source text\nStep 6: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\nStep 7: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction.\n\n## Step 1: Create an informal argument map\n\nI will reconstruct the argumentation as a mini argument map (which just includes 'support' arrows).\n\n```argdown\n[Conclusion 1]: Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ [Premise]: Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n        <+ [Premise]: Pictionary is not an award-winning game for new friends.\n```\n\n## Step 2: Reconstruct the argument in argdown format (premise conclusion structure)\n\nI reconstruct the argument using argdown syntax. Propositional logic should suffice to do so.\n\nLet me set up the abstract argument pattern with the main conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v1'}\n(1) // ... premises to be added here\n-----\n(2) Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n```\n\nLet me add the premises that the argument builds upon.\n\n```argdown {version='v2'}\n(1) Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n(2) Pictionary is not an award-winning game for new friends.\n-----\n(3) Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n```\n\nNow I'll include the inference information to clarify the reasoning steps.\n\n```argdown {version='v3'}\n(1) Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n(2) Pictionary is not an award-winning game for new friends.\n--\nwith disjunctive syllogism from (1) (2)\n--\n(3) Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n```\n\n## Step 3: Identify the title and gist of the argument\n\nWhat's the argument's gist? I'll answer using argdown conventions.\n\n```argdown\n<Pictionary is played>: Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n```\n\n## Step 4: Paraphrase the source text\n\nThe next step is to streamline the argumentative text.\n\nPictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or it is played by partners to get to know each other. It is false that it is an award-winning game for new friends. Therefore, Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the reason statements in the source text\n\nI plan to pinpoint and list the sentences within the text that are presented as reasons in the argumentation.\n\n\"Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or it is played by partners to get to know each other\"\n\"it is false that it is an award-winning game for new friends\"\n\"Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or it is played by partners to get to know each other\"\n\n\n## Step 6: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\n\nI plan to transform the argument into a well-defined, premise-conclusion structure using argdown, identifying any assumptions made. I'll include the argument's title and gist.\n\n```argdown\n<Pictionary is played>: Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n\n(1) Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n(2) Pictionary is not an award-winning game for new friends.\n--\nwith disjunctive syllogism from (1) (2)\n--\n(3) Pictionary is played by partners to get to know each other.\n```\n\n## Step 7: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI plan to clarify the text's argumentative structure through appropriate annotation. In doing so, I'll distinguish passages that serve as reasons in the argumentation from those that are argued for. I'll relate each annotated element to the corresponding proposition in the previously reconstructed argument.\n\n<span class=\"reason\" id=\"3\" ref_reco=\"1\">Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or it is played by partners to get to know each other</span>. Yet <span class=\"reason\" id=\"2\" ref_reco=\"2\">it is false that it is an award-winning game for new friends</span>. And <span class=\"reason\" id=\"3\" ref_reco=\"1\">Pictionary is an award-winning game for new friends or it is played by partners to get to know each other</span>, and a thing that is not both not an award-winning game for teenagers and a classic game for lovers of board game nights to get to know each other is a classic game for old friends to get to know each other and a beloved activity for adults.
