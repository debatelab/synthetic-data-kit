argumentation.\n\n## Step 3: Formalize the premises\n\nI plan to provide latex formalizations for the argument's premises.\n\nLet me formalize each premise in the argument:\nPremise (1): $\\forall x: (\\lnot G(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow (L(x) \\lor M(x))$\nPremise (2): $\\forall x: (L(x) \\rightarrow \\lnot K(x))$\nPremise (3): $\\forall x: (K(x) \\rightarrow \\lnot M(x))$\nPremise (5):

(14): $\\forall x: (\\lnot H(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\n\n## Step 4: Provide placeholder keys (substitutions)\n\nThe argument can be comprehensively formalized with the placeholders: F G H I J K L M N O P Q. What do these placeholders signify? I will clarify their meaning.\n\nThe symbols denote:\nF: fluent speaker of Norwegian\nG: learner of Czech\nH: translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction\nI: translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction\nJ: learner of Spanish in college courses\nK: specialist for Greek\nL: learner of Gujarati in evening classes\nM: native speaker of Russian\nN: language teacher for Italian at university\nO: speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level\nP: native speaker of Swahili\nQ: fluent speaker of Marathi\n\n## Step 5: Formalize the intermediary conclusions\n\nI plan to clarify the logico-semantic structure of the argument's intermediate conclusions by providing formalizations in latex syntax.\n\nThe intermediary conclusions can be formalized as follows:\nIntermediate conclusion (4): $\\forall x: (\\lnot G(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow \\lnot K(x)$\nIntermediate conclusion (6): $\\forall x: (F(x) \\rightarrow (G(x) \\lor \\lnot H(x)))$\nIntermediate conclusion (10): $\\forall x: (O(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\nIntermediate conclusion (13): $\\forall x: (\\lnot (I(x) \\land J(x)) \\rightarrow \\lnot G(x))$\n\n## Step 6: Formalize the main conclusion\n\nI plan to provide a latex formalization for the argument's conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion (15) can be formalized as: $\\forall x: (F(x) \\rightarrow (I(x) \\land J(x)))$\n\n## Step 7: Reconstruct the argument in standard form (Argdown) with title and gist\n\nI plan to reconstruct the argument, identify its premises and conclusion, provide a title, summarize its gist, and express it using argdown, ensuring that the structure is clear and follows logical conventions.\n\n```argdown\n<Learner of Spanish>: If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, because if someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n\n(1) If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n(2) If someone learns Gujarati in evening classes, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n(3) If someone is a specialist for Greek, then they are not a native speaker of Russian.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (1) (2) (3)\n--\n(4) If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n(5) If someone is fluent in Norwegian, then they are a specialist for Greek.\n--\nwith hypothetical syllogism [de_morgan, negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (4) (5)\n--\n(6) If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a learner of Czech, or not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction.\n(7) If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are not a native speaker of Swahili, or a fluent speaker of Marathi.\n(8) If someone is not a native speaker of Swahili, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n(9) If someone is a fluent speaker of Marathi, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant] from (7) (8) (9)\n--\n(10) If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n(11) If someone is a learner of Czech, then they are a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level.\n(12) If someone is a language teacher for Italian at university, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [complex variant, transposition] from (10) (11) (12)\n--\n(13) If it is not the case that someone is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, then they are not a learner of Czech.\n(14) If someone is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n--\nwith generalized dilemma [negation variant, complex variant, transposition] from (6) (13) (14)\n--\n(15) If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n```\n\n## Step 8: Extract the essential source text\n\nI plan to rephrase the source text. I'll avoid extravagant style. I'll be cool and neutral.\n\nNo language teacher for Swedish at school is a native speaker of Gujarati and an amateur speaker of Urdu, and vice versa. Yet somebody who is not both a learner of Korean in evening classes and a learner of Burmese is not a specialist for Sotho, and vice versa, and a person who is not an amateur speaker of Bengali is not a learner of Vietnamese or not a speaker of Arabic at a beginner's level, and vice versa. But everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too. Plus, if Isabella gives courses in Tamil at school, Stephanie gives courses in Japanese at school or Stephanie can talk fluently in Urdu. And every one who is not both a specialist for Quechua and a learner of Odia in school is not a linguist specialised in Italian. Plus, it is true that Ian learns Arabic just in case that not both Harry is proficient in English at an advanced level and Harry speaks Persian at a beginner's level. But Zeynep translates Bengali with a specialization in nonfiction. In addition, being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian. Therefore, everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek. Yet if Elea is a specialist for Tamil, Victoria does not study Wu Chinese in school or Victoria does not translate Amharic with a specialization in nonfiction. Hence, every fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech. And every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both, and it is true that Elif is a native speaker of Odia or Elif tutors Filipino at university just in case that Elif is a specialist for Yoruba. And every person who is neither a linguist specialised in Marathi nor an amateur speaker of Indonesian is not a learner of Spanish in school or a native speaker of Portugues. Plus, everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses. Yet every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. But assuming that Kamila is not a specialist for Hindi or Kamila does not learn Vietnamese, Dylan is not a specialist for Dutch, and someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, and if Harry Sotho translates with a specialty in poetry, Oliver studies Spanish in college courses. Yet a person who is not a speaker of Marathi at a beginner's level and not a learner of Yoruba is not a speaker of Swahili at a beginner's level and a translator for English with a specialization in fiction. Assuming that Charlie does not professionally translate Greek with a specialization in poetry, not both Charlie doesn't interpret Yoruba with a specialization in fiction and Charlie is an autodidact of French. And every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. But a person who is neither not an amateur speaker of Bengali nor a language teacher for Urdu at school is a translator for Marathi with a specialization in poetry, and vice versa. Only if Yuto can't talk fluently in Urdu, Amahle can talk fluently in Mandarin or Amahle is not a linguist specialised in Greek.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the conjectures (derived from reason statement) in the source text\n\nFrom the text, I will identify and list the sentences that function as (intermediary) conclusions in the argumentative structure.\nTo address this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\n* everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek\n* every fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech\n\n\n## Step 10: Identify the reason statements in the source text\n\nI will quote the reason statements from the text.\nFor addressing this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\nLet me provide verbatim quotes from the text that seem to function as reasons in the argumentation:\n* everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too\n* being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian\n* every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both\n* everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n* every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\n* someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n* every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\n\n\n## Step 11: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI will mark the argumentative elements within the text by annotating the reason statements (premises) and conjecture statements (conclusions).

I will construct an inference graph based on these.\n\n```argdown\nevery fluent speaker of Norwegian is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction or a learner of Czech\n    <+ everyone who is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction is not a specialist for Greek\n        <+ being a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian\n    <+ everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too\nevery speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi\nsomeone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\nevery learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both\neveryone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses\n```\n\n## Step 13: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\n\nThe next step is to enrich the argdown argument reconstruction with detailed logical formalizations (latex syntax) . I'll add the formalizations directly to the argdown document by using inline YAML data for each proposition. I'll specify the logical formula and the placeholders used, and maintain consistent key usage across all formalized propositions.\n\nLet me include logical formalizations and keys:\n\n```argdown\n(1)

That is, I'll focus on the argument, leave out extraneous information, and use clear and precise language.\n\nBeing a specialist for Greek is sufficient for not being a native speaker of Russian. Everyone who can talk fluently in Norwegian is a specialist for Greek, too. Every speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level is not a native speaker of Swahili or a fluent speaker of Marathi. Someone who is not a native speaker of Swahili is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses. Every learner of Czech is either a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, or both. Everyone who is a language teacher for Italian at university is also a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n\n## Step 15: Create an informal argument map\n\nI will reconstruct the argumentation as a mini argument map (which just includes 'support' arrows).\n\n```argdown\nIf someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ If someone is a fluent speaker of Norwegian, then they are a learner of Czech, or not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction.\n            <+ <Subargument 2>\n                <+ If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n                    <+ <Subargument 3>\n                        <+ If someone is not a learner of Czech and a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a learner of Gujarati in evening classes or a native speaker of Russian.\n                        <+ If someone learns Gujarati in evening classes, then they are not a specialist for Greek.\n                        <+ If someone is a specialist for Greek, then they are not a native speaker of Russian.\n                <+ If someone is fluent in Norwegian, then they are a specialist for Greek.\n        <+ If it is not the case that someone is a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses, then they are not a learner of Czech.\n            <+ <Subargument 4>\n                <+ If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                    <+ <Subargument 5>\n                        <+ If someone is a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level, then they are not a native speaker of Swahili, or a fluent speaker of Marathi.\n                        <+ If someone is not a native speaker of Swahili, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                        <+ If someone is a fluent speaker of Marathi, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n                <+ If someone is a learner of Czech, then they are a language teacher for Italian at university or a speaker of Portugues at a beginner's level.\n                <+ If someone is a language teacher for Italian at university, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n        <+ If someone is not a translator for Polish with a specialization in fiction, then they are a translator for Dutch with a specialization in fiction and a learner of Spanish in college courses.\n```\n\n## Step 16: Augment the reconstruction with inline yaml data\n\nNow I can address the query: 'I want you to assess the rhetorical style of all propositions. Consider tone, persuasion and complexity. Use tools as appropriate. Integrate the data into your argdown code.'",
