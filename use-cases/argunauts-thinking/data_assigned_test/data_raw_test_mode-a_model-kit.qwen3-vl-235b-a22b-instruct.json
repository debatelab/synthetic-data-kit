        "content": "Begin by examining the following argumentative text:\nLadies and gentlemen, the question of whether Edwin is a grandson of Marvin is a matter of great importance, and one that requires careful consideration. Let us begin by examining the relationships between the individuals in question.\n\nFirstly, we know that anyone who is not a direct descendant of Joseph or a colleague of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo. This means that they are not an ancestor of Aaron and therefore cannot be related to him through a direct line of descent.\n\nNow, if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, then Brent is indeed a schoolmate of Francis. However, we must note that Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. This tells us that Kevin's relationship with these individuals is not as straightforward as it could be.\n\nWe also know that Santo is a half-brother of Don, and this relationship is important to our understanding of the question at hand. If, and only if, it is not the case that Edward is a schoolmate of Corey or Edward works with Ron, then Edward is not a stepbrother of Jordon. This is because Kevin is a brother of Perry, and if Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n\nFurthermore, if Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if Terry is not a great-grandfather of Tracy, then it is not the case that both Terry is a nephew of Lewis and Terry is a son of Mohammed. This is an important distinction, as it highlights the complexity of Terry's relationships with these individuals.\n\nWe also know that if Tom is not a nephew of Glenn, then it is not the case that Greg is an ancestor of Tracy. This is because the two statements are related, and if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nNow, if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. This is an interesting relationship, as it highlights the connections between these individuals across multiple generations.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the relationship between Nelson and Wesely. If Nelson is not a nephew of Jacob and Nelson is an ancestor of Wesley, then Sam is a nephew of Roger. This is a significant relationship, as it highlights the connections between these individuals through their ancestry.\n\nFinally, if Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo does not work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. And since it is false that Santo works with John, it follows that Santo is indeed a half-brother of Don and does not work with John.\n\nIn conclusion, our examination of the relationships between the individuals in question has led us to a crucial conclusion. Anyone who is not an uncle of Joel is neither a workmate of Allan nor a half-brother of Christopher. This tells us that there are certain relationships that are mutually exclusive, and that we must carefully consider these relationships when determining the truth of the statement that Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnalyse the given text so that you can and do answer the following query: 'Jasmine Donovan holds that 6 are all true, and hasn't made any further commitments. Is that position deductively closed given our logical analysis?'",

        "thinking": "Hm, this requires a complex argumentative analysis. Better to set up a plan before I start.\n\nStep 1: Identify the title, gist, and conclusion of the argument\nStep 2: Extract the essential source text\nStep 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\nStep 4: Create an informal argument map\nStep 5: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\nStep 6: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\nStep 7: Evaluate the argument and answer the question\n\n## Step 1: Identify the title, gist, and conclusion of the argument\n\nHow shall we call this argument (title)? What's the key point (gist)? What does it seek to show (conclusion)? I shall answer by using Argdown.\n\n```argdown\n<Half-brother of Don>: Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, because if Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n    +> Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\n## Step 2: Extract the essential source text\n\nI will recast the source text in my own words. The context is: An argument essentially about whether Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n\nEach person who is not a son of Joseph or a workmate of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo and not an ancestor of Aaron. Plus, only if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, Brent is a schoolmate of Francis. But Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. Yet Santo is a half-brother of Don. And if, and only if, it is not the case that Edward is a schoolmate of Corey or Edward works with Ron, then Edward is not a stepbrother of Jordon, since Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl, and if Jose is a nephew of Earl, Santo is a half-brother of Don, and only if Terry is not a great-grandfather of Tracy, not both Terry is a nephew of Lewis and Terry is a son of Mohammed. Yet it is not the case that Tom is not a nephew of Glenn or Greg is an ancestor of Tracy. Assuming that Kevin is a brother of Perry, Carlos is a cousin of Parker. But if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, Santo is a half-brother of Don. Adding to this, only if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. Plus, a person who is an uncle of Ned or a cousin of Eric is not a classmate of George and a classmate of Zachary. And if not both Nelson is not a nephew of Jacob and Nelson is an ancestor of Wesley, then, and only then, Sam is a nephew of Roger. And if Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. Yet it is false that Santo works with John. It follows that Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John. Everyone who is not an uncle of Joel is neither a workmate of Allan nor not a half-brother of Christopher.\n\n## Step 3: Create an inference graph that represents the argument structure\n\nAn inference tree outlines the logical relations between premises and conclusions in an argument. I will characterize the argumentative structure of the text by means of an inference graph. I'll stick to explicitly mentioned reasons and conjectures.\n\n```argdown\nSanto is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John\n    <+ Santo is a half-brother of Don\n        <+ Assuming that Kevin is a brother of Perry, Carlos is a cousin of Parker\n        <+ if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, Santo is a half-brother of Don\n        <+ Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl\n        <+ if Jose is a nephew of Earl, Santo is a half-brother of Don\n    <+ it is false that Santo works with John\nif Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\nonly if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\n```\n\n## Step 4: Create an informal argument map\n\nFor the next step in our analysis, I plan to reconstruct the overall reasoning as rational argumentation. This may involve adding implicit premises and conclusions (not mentioned in the text). I'll describe the argumentation in terms of subarguments that build on each other and jointly justify a final conclusion. I will not use premise/conclusion standard form here. Rather I'll create a mini argument map.\n\n```argdown\n[Conclusion 1]: Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n    <+ <Subargument 1>\n        <+ [Conclusion 2]: Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n            <+ <Subargument 2>\n                <+ [Conclusion 3]: Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John.\n                    <+ <Subargument 3>\n                        <+ [Conclusion 4]: Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                            <+ <Subargument 4>\n                                <+ [Conclusion 5]: If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                                    <+ <Subargument 5>\n                                        <+ [Premise]: If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n                                        <+ [Premise]: If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                                <+ [Premise]: Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n                                <+ [Premise]: If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n                        <+ [Premise]: Santo doesn't work with John.\n                <+ [Premise]: If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n        <+ [Premise]: If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\n## Step 5: Reconstruct the argument in Argdown syntax including logical formalizations\n\nI will add detailed logical formalizations to the argdown argument reconstruction by including them as inline YAML data for each proposition. I'll specify the logical formulas (latex syntax) and the placeholders used in each formula. I'll maintain consistency in the use of keys when formalizing different propositions throughout the argument.\n\nI'll sketch the basic argument structure with the final conclusion.\n\n```argdown {version='v1'}\n(1) // ... premises to be added here\n-----\n(2) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll add the premises of the argument.\n\n```argdown {version='v2'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(3) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n(4) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(5) Santo doesn't work with John.\n(6) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n(7) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n// ... intermediate conclusions to be added here\n-----\n(8) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll include the intermediate steps in the reasoning chain.\n\n```argdown {version='v3'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker.\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n-----\n(3) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(4) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl.\n(5) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n-----\n(6) Santo is a half-brother of Don.\n(7) Santo doesn't work with John.\n-----\n(8) Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John.\n(9) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n-----\n(10) Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith.\n(11) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n-----\n(12) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin.\n```\n\nNow I'll add the YAML metadata that enriches the argument.\n\n```argdown {version='v4'}\n(1) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Carlos is a cousin of Parker. {\"formalization\": \"p \\rightarrow q\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"q\": \"Carlos is a cousin of Parker\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n(2) If Carlos is a cousin of Parker, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"q \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"q\": \"Carlos is a cousin of Parker\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(3) If Kevin is a brother of Perry, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"p \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}, \"follows_from\": [1, 2]}\n(4) Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl. {\"formalization\": \"p \\lor s\", \"keys\": {\"p\": \"Kevin is a brother of Perry\", \"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"s\": \"Jose is a nephew of Earl\"}}\n(5) If Jose is a nephew of Earl, then Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"s \\rightarrow r\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"s\": \"Jose is a nephew of Earl\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(6) Santo is a half-brother of Don. {\"formalization\": \"r\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [3, 4, 5]}\n(7) Santo doesn't work with John. {\"formalization\": \"\\lnot t\", \"keys\": {\"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\"}}\n-----\n(8) Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John. {\"formalization\": \"r \\land \\lnot t\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\"}, \"follows_from\": [6, 7]}\n(9) If Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, then Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. {\"formalization\": \"(r \\land \\lnot t) \\rightarrow u\", \"keys\": {\"r\": \"Santo is a half-brother of Don\", \"t\": \"Santo is a workmate of John\", \"u\": \"Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(10) Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith. {\"formalization\": \"u\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [8, 9]}\n(11) If Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith, then Edwin is a grandson of Marvin. {\"formalization\": \"u \\rightarrow w\", \"keys\": {\"u\": \"Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith\", \"w\": \"Edwin is a grandson of Marvin\"}}\n-----\n(12) Edwin is a grandson of Marvin. {\"formalization\": \"w\", \"keys\": {}, \"follows_from\": [10, 11]}\n```\n\n## Step 6: Annotate the source text with references to argument reconstruction\n\nI will identify and annotate the premises and conclusions in the text to clarify its argumentative structure. I'll include references to the reconstructed argument.\nTo address this query, work with your own paraphrase of the original text.\n\nEach person who is not a son of Joseph or a workmate of Frederick is a cousin of Carlo and not an ancestor of Aaron. Plus, only if Brian is a half-brother of Freddy or Brian is an uncle of Adam, Brent is a schoolmate of Francis. But Kevin is neither a schoolmate of Alvin nor an uncle of Jon. Yet <conjecture id=\"1\" supports=\"9\" ref_reco=\"6\">Santo is a half-brother of Don</conjecture>. And if, and only if, it is not the case that Edward is a schoolmate of Corey or Edward works with Ron, then Edward is not a stepbrother of Jordon, since <reason id=\"2\" supports=\"1\" ref_reco=\"4\">Kevin is a brother of Perry or Jose is a nephew of Earl</reason>, and <reason id=\"3\" supports=\"1\" ref_reco=\"5\">if Jose is a nephew of Earl, Santo is a half-brother of Don</reason>, and only if Terry is not a great-grandfather of Tracy, not both Terry is a nephew of Lewis and Terry is a son of Mohammed. Yet it is not the case that Tom is not a nephew of Glenn or Greg is an ancestor of Tracy. <reason id=\"4\" ref_reco=\"1\">Assuming that Kevin is a brother of Perry, Carlos is a cousin of Parker</reason>. But <reason id=\"5\" ref_reco=\"2\">if Carlos is a cousin of Parker, Santo is a half-brother of Don</reason>. Adding to this, <reason id=\"6\" ref_reco=\"11\">only if Edwin is a grandson of Marvin, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith</reason>. Plus, a person who is an uncle of Ned or a cousin of Eric is not a classmate of George and a classmate of Zachary. And if not both Nelson is not a nephew of Jacob and Nelson is an ancestor of Wesley, then, and only then, Sam is a nephew of Roger. And <reason id=\"7\" ref_reco=\"9\">if Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John, Paul is a great-grandfather of Keith</reason>. Yet <reason id=\"8\" supports=\"9\" ref_reco=\"7\">it is false that Santo works with John</reason>. It follows that <conjecture id=\"9\" ref_reco=\"8\">Santo is a half-brother of Don and Santo doesn't work with John</conjecture>. Everyone who is not an uncle of Joel is neither a workmate of Allan nor not a half-brother of Christopher.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the argument and answer the question\n\nSo now I can consider the query: 'Jasmine Donovan holds that 6 are all true, and hasn't made any further commitments. Is that position deductively closed given our logical analysis?'\n\nYes, Jasmine Donovan's position is deductively closed.",
